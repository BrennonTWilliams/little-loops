# Decide Issue

Resolves multi-option implementation decisions by gathering codebase evidence for each option and selecting the best fit. Where `/ll:refine-issue --auto` deposits competing approaches and sets `decision_needed: true`, this skill closes the loop — scoring every option and annotating the winner directly in the issue file.

## When to Use

Run after `/ll:refine-issue` when `decision_needed: true` is set in the issue frontmatter:
- The Proposed Solution section contains 2+ competing implementation options
- The pipeline is blocked because no single approach has been selected
- You want an evidence-based decision rather than a gut-check pick

Can also be run manually on any issue that has multiple options in its Proposed Solution, even without `decision_needed: true`.

## Arguments

```
/ll:decide-issue [<issue-id>] [--auto] [--dry-run] [--validate-only]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--auto` | Non-interactive mode: write decision without prompting |
| `--dry-run` | Preview the decision without modifying the issue file |
| `--validate-only` | Probe decidability only (Phases 1–2.5); no scoring, no writes. Exit 0 if there is something to decide, exit 1 with `OPTIONS_MISSING` otherwise (ENH-2443) |
| `--deposit-attempted` | Internal runtime flag, not a CLI arg — Phase 2.5 sets this after invoking `/ll:refine-issue --auto` once, bounding the auto-recovery retry to a single attempt per invocation (ENH-2443) |

**Examples:**
```bash
/ll:decide-issue FEAT-948
/ll:decide-issue ENH-277 --auto
/ll:decide-issue BUG-042 --auto --dry-run
/ll:decide-issue FEAT-398 --auto --validate-only
```

---

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

```
ISSUE_ID = ""
AUTO_MODE = false
DRY_RUN = false
VALIDATE_ONLY = false
DEPOSIT_ATTEMPTED = false   # internal — never read from ARGUMENTS; set by Phase 2.5 itself

# Auto-enable in automation contexts
if ARGUMENTS contains "--dangerously-skip-permissions" or env LL_NON_INTERACTIVE is set or env DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS is set: AUTO_MODE = true

# Explicit flags
if ARGUMENTS contains "--auto": AUTO_MODE = true
if ARGUMENTS contains "--dry-run": DRY_RUN = true
if ARGUMENTS contains "--validate-only": VALIDATE_ONLY = true

# Extract issue ID (first non-flag token)
for token in ARGUMENTS:
    if not starts with "--": ISSUE_ID = token; break

if ISSUE_ID is empty:
    print "Error: issue_id is required"
    print "Usage: /ll:decide-issue [ISSUE_ID] [--auto] [--dry-run] [--validate-only]"
    exit 1
```

---

## Phase 2: Locate Issue File

```bash
FILE=$(ll-issues path "${ISSUE_ID}" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: Issue $ISSUE_ID not found"
    exit 1
fi
```

Read the full issue file to extract:
- YAML frontmatter (particularly `decision_needed`)
- The full "## Proposed Solution" section text
- Issue title and type for context

---

## Phase 2.5: Decidability Gate (ENH-2443)

Before spending a full scoring pass (or, for direct/FSM callers, before running at all),
determine whether there is anything to decide. Run the **same extraction patterns as Phase
3** (Patterns 1–4, including the Pattern 4 → `## Codebase Research Findings` /
`## Implementation Status` widening when Proposed Solution yields 0) to compute `OPTIONS`.
Do not score, do not spawn agents, do not write to the issue file in this phase.

**Branch:**
- `OPTIONS >= 1` → decidable. If `VALIDATE_ONLY`: exit 0. Otherwise: continue to Phase 3
  (which re-runs extraction normally; the Phase 2.5 count is a pre-check, not a cache).
- `OPTIONS == 0`:
  - If `VALIDATE_ONLY`: emit `OPTIONS_MISSING` (see token shape below) and exit 1.
  - If not `VALIDATE_ONLY` and `AUTO_MODE = true` and `DEPOSIT_ATTEMPTED = false`: invoke
    `/ll:refine-issue ${ISSUE_ID} --auto` once, set `DEPOSIT_ATTEMPTED = true`, then re-run
    the Phase 2.5 extraction against the (possibly changed) issue content. Whether the
    re-scan now finds `OPTIONS >= 1` or still `OPTIONS == 0`, `DEPOSIT_ATTEMPTED` is now
    `true`, so the next bullet's condition applies — fall through to Phase 3, which falls
    through to Phase 3b's inline provisional-language scan when `AUTO_MODE = true` and
    `OPTIONS == 0` (Pattern D can lock in a clear winner even when no formal
    `### Option A/B` blocks exist). `MANUAL_REVIEW_RECOMMENDED` is no longer emitted from
    this phase: an exhausted retry now reaches Phase 3b before any manual-review
    disposition is considered, rather than short-circuiting to one.
  - If not `VALIDATE_ONLY` and (`AUTO_MODE = false` or `DEPOSIT_ATTEMPTED = true`): fall
    through to Phase 3 unchanged — Phase 3's own `OPTIONS` empty-handling (interactive
    "nothing to decide" message, or Phase 3b's inline scan in auto mode) already covers
    this case and remains the source of truth for non-validate-only runs that reach it a
    second time.

### `OPTIONS_MISSING` token shape

```
## RESULT: OPTIONS_MISSING
reason: decision_needed is true but ## Proposed Solution has no enumerable alternatives
suggested_command: /ll:refine-issue ${ISSUE_ID} --auto
exit_code: 1
```

---

## Phase 3: Extract Options

Scan the Proposed Solution section for options using these patterns (in order of precedence). If Proposed Solution yields 0 options, repeat the scan over `## Codebase Research Findings` and `## Implementation Status` — refined issues often deposit options there.

### Pattern 1 — Section Headers
```
Match: lines matching /^### Option [A-Z0-9]/i
Example: ### Option A, ### Option B, ### Option C
Extract: the header text as the option title; body text until next ### or ## as option description
```

### Pattern 2 — Bold Labels
```
Match: lines starting with **Option [A-Z0-9]** or **Option [0-9]+**
Example: **Option A (recommended)**: ..., **Option B**: ...
Extract: the bold label (stripped of **) as option title; rest of the line and following paragraph as description
```

### Pattern 3 — Numbered Top-Level Items
```
Match: numbered list items at top level: /^[0-9]+\.\s+\*\*Option/ or /^[0-9]+\.\s+[A-Z][^.]+approach/
Example: 1. **Option A** (chosen): ..., 2. Use existing utility ...
Extract: the item label or leading phrase as option title; full item text as description
Note: only apply this pattern if Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 found 0 options
```

### Pattern 4 — Bullet-List Options
```
Match: bullet items naming lettered/numbered options: /^[-*]\s+\(([a-z0-9])\)\s+/ or /^[-*]\s+\*?\*?Option\s+([A-Z0-9])/
Example: - (a) useEffect in SettingsSheet…, - (b) Hoist into App.tsx…, - **Option A**: …
Extract: the (x)/Option label as option title; body text until the next bullet or heading as description
Note: only apply if Patterns 1–3 found 0 options
```

### Option Count Check

After extraction:

**Auto-mode bullet-list handling**: if the ONLY options found came from Pattern 4 and `AUTO_MODE = true`, do NOT route them to Phase 4 scoring — automation must not re-litigate an informal list the author may have already settled. Set `OPTIONS = 0` so flow proceeds to Phase 3b, where Pattern D resolves the case: a declarative recommendation marker naming one of the bullet options locks it in; absent a marker, `decision_needed` stays `true` for human review. In interactive mode, Pattern-4 options ARE scored through Phases 4–7 normally.

- If `OPTIONS` is empty and `AUTO_MODE = false`: print `No options found in Proposed Solution — nothing to decide.` and exit cleanly
- If `OPTIONS` is empty and `AUTO_MODE = true`: proceed to Phase 3b (Inline Decision Scan)
- If `len(OPTIONS) == 1`: print `Only one option present — no decision required. Clearing decision_needed if set.` then proceed to Phase 7 (frontmatter update only: set `decision_needed: false`)
- If `len(OPTIONS) >= 2`: proceed to Phase 4

---

## Phase 3b: Inline Decision Scan (AUTO_MODE only)

**Precondition**: `AUTO_MODE = true` AND `OPTIONS = 0` after Phase 3 pattern scan.

### Phase 3b-i: Skip resolved questions

Before scanning for provisional language, collect all numbered list items under the `## Open Questions` section and check each for a resolution marker:

- `✅ RESOLVED`, `✔ RESOLVED`, `**RESOLVED**`, `> **RESOLVED**`

Markers appear inline after the bold question label, e.g.:
`**Fork vs. flag.** ✅ **RESOLVED** (2026-06-04 by …)`

**If the `## Open Questions` section exists with items and they are ALL marked resolved, and `decision_needed: true`**:

1. Output:
   ```
   ## RESULT: NO_ACTIONABLE_DECISIONS — all questions already marked resolved
   decision_needed remains true (human-required decision; automation cannot clear a flag it did not earn)
   ```
2. Do NOT edit the issue file.
3. Do NOT clear `decision_needed` — leave it as `true`.
4. Exit 0, then proceed to Phase 8 (Append Session Log) only. Skip Phases 4–7 and Phase 9.

**If the section is absent, has no items, or has at least one unresolved item**, fall through to the provisional-language scan below — do NOT take the `NO_ACTIONABLE_DECISIONS` exit. An absent `## Open Questions` section is not "nothing to decide": options and recommendations commonly live in `## Proposed Solution` or `## Codebase Research Findings`. When the section exists, scope the scan to its unresolved items only.

---

Scan ALL sections of the issue file (not just `## Proposed Solution`) for provisional decision language using these patterns:

### Provisional Pattern A — Parenthetical `(e.g., ...)`
```
Match: parenthetical containing `e.g.,` followed by a concrete name
Example: (e.g., completed_at: frontmatter field)
Candidate: the specific approach named inside the parenthetical
```

### Provisional Pattern B — Inline `TBD` design marker
```
Match: `TBD` used as a placeholder for a design decision (not a research gap)
Surrounding context must name a single approach being considered
Example: "field name: TBD (leaning toward completed_at)"
Candidate: the approach mentioned in the surrounding sentence
```

### Provisional Pattern C — Definitive replacement language
```
Match: phrases like "fundamental rethink" / "must be replaced with" / "should be replaced by"
Example: "the existing approach must be replaced with direct file writes"
Candidate: the concrete replacement approach named
```

### Provisional Pattern D — Declarative recommendation
```
Match: prose naming a winning option without a provisional wrapper:
  **Recommended**: (b)  /  the recommendation is now (b)  /  Refresh N supersedes prior — (a)+(b)
Candidate: the referenced option(s); multi-part winners like (a)+(b) are allowed.
Requirement: the referent must exist as a Pattern-4 bullet option in `## Proposed Solution` or
`## Codebase Research Findings` (existing-bullet case), OR the referent must be one of 2+
concrete alternatives named inline in an unresolved `## Open Questions` item (ENH-2715) — e.g.
"could do X or Y" with a stated preference; no pre-existing bullet is required for this shape,
since the alternatives are materialized as structured options in Resolution Logic step 1 below.
A marker (or an Open-Questions item naming a preference among 2+ alternatives) with a
resolvable referent is a **clear winner** — treat as decided.
```

For each provisional pattern match, read 3–5 lines of surrounding context to determine if one approach is clearly stated (not merely listed as a possibility).

### Resolution Logic

Classify each match as:
- **Clear winner**: the provisional wrapper names exactly one concrete approach and surrounding context treats it as the intended design.
- **Ambiguous**: multiple alternatives listed, no single preference expressed.

**If exactly one clear winner is found:**

1. **Materialize alternatives, if not already structured (ENH-2715)**: check whether the clear
   winner's named alternatives already exist as `### Option A`/`### Option B` (Pattern 1) or
   `**Option A**`/`**Option B**` (Pattern 2) blocks under `## Proposed Solution`. They do NOT
   for two cases this step exists to handle: (a) the referent is only a Pattern-4 bullet (`- (a)
   ...` / `- (b) ...`), or (b) the referent is an Open-Questions-named alternative with no
   pre-existing bullet at all. For either case, rewrite the named alternatives in place as
   `**Option A**`/`**Option B**` blocks under `## Proposed Solution`, reusing the exact
   bold-label template `commands/refine-issue.md`'s "Decision-Point Formatting" rule already
   produces (ENH-2607) — additive/rewrite-in-place of the same prose already matched, never
   inventing alternatives beyond what was named:
   ```markdown
   **Option A**: [first alternative, verbatim from the existing text]

   **Option B**: [second alternative, verbatim from the existing text]
   ```
   If the alternatives were already structured as Pattern 1/2 blocks, this step is a no-op —
   proceed directly to step 3.
2. **Re-scan and route to full scoring (ENH-2715)**: after materializing, re-run the Phase 3
   extraction. If it now finds `OPTIONS >= 2` (the materialized blocks match Pattern 2): log
   `✓ Phase 3b: materialized informal decision as structured options — proceeding to Phase 4
   scoring`, then proceed directly to **Phase 4** (Gather Codebase Evidence) for full
   evidence-based scoring instead of the lock-in-only exit in step 3. Phase 4–7 independently
   adds the `> **Selected:**` callout and `### Decision Rationale` subsection once scoring
   completes, and Phase 7b sets `decision_needed: false` — skip steps 3–4 below for this path.
3. **Lock in without scoring** (alternatives were already structured, or materialization found
   no 2+-alternative shape to reformat): edit the issue text to make the approach declarative —
   for Patterns A–C remove the provisional qualifier (`e.g.,`/parenthetical wrapper, `TBD`,
   `"must be replaced with"`); for Pattern D add a `> **Selected:** (x) — per the stated
   recommendation` callout on the recommended bullet. State the concrete approach as decided.
4. Use the Edit tool (inline `---` block replacement — same pattern as Phase 7b) to set `decision_needed: false` in the issue frontmatter:
   ```
   READ the current --- frontmatter block (from opening --- to closing ---)
   FIND the decision_needed field:
     IF field exists: replace its value with false
     IF field absent: add decision_needed: false after the last existing field
   USE Edit tool to replace the entire --- block with the updated block
   ```
   **Idempotency**: if `decision_needed` is already `false`, skip the write and log `✓ decision_needed already false — no update needed`.
5. Log: `✓ Phase 3b: resolved provisional decision — [approach] locked in; decision_needed set to false`
6. Proceed to Phase 8 (Append Session Log) and Phase 9 (Output Report), skipping Phases 4–7 — except the materialize-and-score path in step 2, which proceeds through Phase 4–7 normally before reaching Phase 8/9.

**If no clear winner (zero candidates or all ambiguous):**
1. Log: `✗ Phase 3b: no resolvable provisional decision found — leaving decision_needed unchanged`
2. Leave `decision_needed: true` unchanged.
3. Exit cleanly — do not prompt the user, do not ask interactive questions.
4. Proceed to Phase 8 (Append Session Log) only — skip Phases 4–7 and Phase 9's normal report.

---

## Phase 4: Gather Codebase Evidence (Parallel Agents)

Spawn one `ll:codebase-pattern-finder` Agent **per option** in a **single message** with multiple Agent tool calls. Use `run_in_background: false` and wait for all to complete before proceeding.

For each option, the agent prompt template is:

```
Use Agent tool with subagent_type="ll:codebase-pattern-finder"

Prompt:
Find codebase evidence for or against this implementation option for {{ISSUE_ID}}.

Issue: {{ISSUE_ID}} — {{issue title}}

Option being evaluated: "{{option_title}}"
Option description: {{option_description}}

Find:
1. Existing patterns that use this approach — similar implementations already in the codebase
2. Call site count — how many places currently use a similar pattern
3. Existing utilities, helpers, or modules that this option could reuse
4. Patterns that conflict with or differ from this approach (evidence against)
5. Test patterns for this type of implementation

Return:
- Evidence FOR: existing patterns, utilities, call sites (with file:line references)
- Evidence AGAINST: conflicting patterns or missing utilities that would require new infrastructure
- Reuse score: 0 (builds from scratch) to 3 (reuses existing utilities directly)
- Summary: 1-2 sentence assessment of codebase fit
```

**Wait for ALL agents to complete before proceeding to Phase 5.**

---

## Phase 5: Score Each Option

For each option, produce a score across 4 dimensions (0–3 each, 12 max):

| Dimension | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|
| **Consistency** | Contradicts existing patterns | Partial fit | Mostly consistent | Matches patterns exactly |
| **Simplicity** | High complexity, many new abstractions | Moderate complexity | Mostly straightforward | Minimal code, no new abstractions |
| **Testability** | Hard to isolate/mock | Requires significant test scaffolding | Testable with some effort | Easily unit-testable |
| **Risk** | High risk (broad surface, unknowns) | Medium risk | Low risk, contained scope | Negligible risk |

**Scoring rules:**
- Use the agent evidence from Phase 4 to inform the Consistency score (agent's `reuse_score` feeds directly)
- Apply scores based on the option description and codebase findings — not assumptions
- If two options tie, prefer the one with higher Consistency (codebase fit is the tiebreaker)
- Document specific evidence citations for each score

Produce a per-option scoring record:

```
OPTIONS_SCORED:
  - title: "Option A"
    scores: { consistency: N, simplicity: N, testability: N, risk: N }
    total: N/12
    evidence_for: [key findings]
    evidence_against: [key findings]
  - title: "Option B"
    ...

SELECTED: title of highest-scoring option
RATIONALE: 2-3 sentence explanation citing evidence
```

---

## Phase 6: Prepare Annotation

Build the annotation content before any file writes:

### Selected Option Callout

Locate the winning option's text in the issue. Insert immediately after the option's title/label line:

```markdown
> **Selected:** [option title] — [one-line rationale]
```

### Decision Rationale Subsection

Append to the end of the Proposed Solution section:

```markdown
### Decision Rationale

Decided by `/ll:decide-issue` on YYYY-MM-DD.

**Selected**: [option title]

**Reasoning**: [2-3 sentence explanation citing specific codebase evidence]

#### Scoring Summary

| Option | Consistency | Simplicity | Testability | Risk | Total |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|------|-------|
| [Option A] | N/3 | N/3 | N/3 | N/3 | N/12 |
| [Option B] | N/3 | N/3 | N/3 | N/3 | N/12 |

**Key evidence**:
- [Option A]: [1-2 sentence evidence summary]
- [Option B]: [1-2 sentence evidence summary]
```

---

## Phase 7: Apply Changes

**If `DRY_RUN` is true**: skip all file writes — output the full annotation content in the DRY RUN PREVIEW block (see Phase 9 output report) then exit.

### 7a: Annotate Issue File

Use the Edit tool to:
1. Insert the `> **Selected:** ...` callout immediately after the winning option's title line in the Proposed Solution section
2. Append the `### Decision Rationale` subsection at the end of the Proposed Solution section (before the next `##` heading)

**Idempotency rule**: if the issue already contains a `### Decision Rationale` section, skip the annotation write and log `⚠ Decision already annotated — skipping annotation (idempotent)`. Only proceed to the frontmatter update.

### 7b: Update Frontmatter

Set `decision_needed: false` in the issue's YAML frontmatter using the Edit tool inline `---` block replacement pattern:

```
READ the current --- frontmatter block (from opening --- to closing ---)
FIND the decision_needed field:
  IF field exists: replace its value with false
  IF field absent: add decision_needed: false after the last existing field

USE Edit tool to replace the entire --- block with the updated block
```

**Idempotency**: if `decision_needed` is already `false`, skip the write and log `✓ decision_needed already false — no update needed`.

Append a decision entry to the log (silent no-op when the decisions log is absent). Storage is hybrid — a legacy `.ll/decisions.yaml` flat file and/or `.ll/decisions.d/*.json` fragments — so gate on either (a fresh, never-compacted install has only the fragment dir):

```bash
if [ -f .ll/decisions.yaml ] || [ -d .ll/decisions.d ]; then
    ll-issues decisions add \
      --type=decision \
      --category="architecture" \
      --issue="{{issue_id}}" \
      --rule="$SELECTED_OPTION_TITLE" \
      --rationale="$RATIONALE" \
      --alternatives-rejected="$ALTERNATIVES_REJECTED" \
      2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

---

## Phase 8: Append Session Log

```bash
ll-issues append-log <path-to-issue-file> /ll:decide-issue
```

If `ll-issues` is not available, append manually to the Session Log section:

```
- `/ll:decide-issue` - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS - `<absolute path to session JSONL>`
```

Stage the updated file:

```bash
git add "{{issue_file_path}}"
```

---

## Phase 9: Output Report

See [reference.md](reference.md) for the full Output Report template (issue summary,
options table, scoring table, decision, changes applied, dry-run preview, next steps).

---

## Integration

### Pipeline Position

```
/ll:capture-issue → /ll:format-issue → /ll:refine-issue → /ll:decide-issue → /ll:wire-issue → /ll:ready-issue → /ll:manage-issue
```

- **Before**: `/ll:refine-issue --auto` — deposits implementation options, sets `decision_needed: true`
- **After**: `/ll:wire-issue` — traces callers and integration points for the now-selected implementation approach

### When to Use vs. Related Commands

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `refine-issue` | Fills knowledge gaps; may deposit competing options |
| `decide-issue` | Selects the best option from competing alternatives using codebase evidence |
| `wire-issue` | Traces all wiring touchpoints for the selected implementation |
| `confidence-check` | Evaluates implementation readiness score |

`decide-issue` is specifically for the "refine-issue deposited multiple options but hasn't selected one" problem. It consumes `decision_needed: true` and produces a clear, annotated winner so the pipeline can continue.

### FSM callers

FSM `shell` states cannot invoke slash commands directly (no LLM dispatch from a
subprocess), so `--validate-only` is a skill-level flag for direct/interactive use only.
FSM-driven loops (`rn-remediate`, `autodev`) instead call the deterministic companion CLI
`ll-issues check-decidable <ID>` — a pure-Python re-implementation of the same Patterns
1–4 counting logic (no LLM, no scoring, no write) — as a cheap pre-`decide` gate: exit 0
means "decide has something to act on", exit 1 routes the loop through
`/ll:refine-issue --auto` to deposit options before retrying (ENH-2443). This mirrors the
`ensure_formatted` → `ll-issues format-check` precedent (ENH-2426): the skill documents
the human-facing behavior, a companion CLI gives automation a real non-LLM evaluator.
