    verdict: "Excellent candidate — use it"
    notes: |
      Comprehensive Next.js 15 boilerplate with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
      Excellent test coverage (Vitest, Playwright E2E, Storybook). Strong code quality tooling
      (ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Commitlint). Requires Node 22+, Clerk API keys, and database
      setup which lowers build simplicity. Mainstream stack with active maintenance.

    verdict: "Good candidate — minor gaps to work around"
    notes: |
      Clean React + TypeScript starter with Vite and TailwindCSS. Simpler setup than
      Next.js alternatives - just pnpm install and run. Has Jest + Testing Library
      for unit tests but lacks E2E testing. Good code quality tooling (ESLint, Prettier,
      Husky). Smaller footprint makes it easier to demo in real-time.

    verdict: "Good candidate — minor gaps to work around"
    notes: |
      Professional React Native boilerplate from TheCodingMachine agency. Well-documented
      architecture with TypeScript support. Lower build simplicity score due to React Native
      environment setup (iOS/Android SDKs required). Mobile demo may be harder to showcase
      in live settings. Good choice for mobile-focused demos but requires more setup time.
