## `harness-optimize`

**Category**: optimization
**File**: `scripts/little_loops/loops/harness-optimize.yaml`

Score-gated hill-climbing on harness artifacts (skills, commands, `CLAUDE.md`). Each iteration proposes an edit to a declared target file set, runs a Harbor-format benchmark, accepts the change if the score rises (or reaches the target threshold), and reverts otherwise. Accepted mutations are committed to the current branch. Stops on the first stall.

### Invocation

Via `.ll/program.md` (recommended for overnight runs):

```bash
# Populate .ll/program.md with Directive, Targets, Benchmark sections, then:
ll-loop run harness-optimize
```

Via `--context` flags:

```bash
ll-loop run harness-optimize \
  --context targets="skills/foo/SKILL.md" \
  --context tasks_dir=./benchmarks/foo \
  --context scorer=./scripts/score.sh
```

Multiple targets (space-separated):

```bash
ll-loop run harness-optimize \
  --context "targets=skills/foo/SKILL.md skills/bar/SKILL.md" \
  --context tasks_dir=./benchmarks/foo \
  --context scorer=./scripts/score.sh
```

See [`.ll/program.md` convention](program-md.md) for the steering file format and precedence rules.

### Context Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `targets` | `""` | **Required.** Space-separated file paths to optimize (e.g. `"skills/foo/SKILL.md"`). |
| `tasks_dir` | `""` | **Required.** Path to Harbor task directory passed to scorer. |
| `scorer` | `""` | **Required.** Scorer command that prints a bare float to stdout on exit 0. |
| `target_score` | `1.0` | Early-stop threshold. `1.0` means "never early-stop on target reached". |
| `max_iterations` | `30` | Hard budget ceiling. |

### State Graph

```
load_directive  (reads .ll/program.md Directive section → captured.directive.output)
  → baseline_score (fragment: run_benchmark)
    on_yes → init_prev
      → propose (LLM: uses directive + targets to pick one file and propose an edit)
        → apply (LLM: write candidate to file)
          → score (fragment: run_benchmark)
            on_yes → gate (convergence evaluator, direction: maximize)
              target/progress → commit_and_log
                → write_trajectory_accepted
                  → capture_prev → propose  (continues)
              stall/error → revert_and_log
                → write_trajectory_rejected → done
            on_no/on_error → revert_and_log → write_trajectory_rejected → done
    on_no/on_error → done
```

### Trajectory

Each iteration appends one JSON line to `.loops/tmp/harness-optimize-trajectory.jsonl`:

```json
{"iter": 3, "score": 0.82, "accepted": true, "commit_sha": "abc1234"}
{"iter": 4, "score": 0.79, "accepted": false, "commit_sha": ""}
```

### Resume Behavior

On resume, `load_directive` reads the trajectory and checks out the best-scoring accepted commit's files before re-running the baseline. It also re-reads `.ll/program.md` to capture the Directive prose, ensuring the LLM proposal step has the optimization goal available even after a handoff. The run continues from the best known state, not the last attempted state.

### Scorer Contract

The scorer command must follow the Harbor scorer protocol:
- Exit 0 + bare float on stdout → `yes` (accepted score)
- Exit 0 + non-float stdout → `error`
- Exit non-zero → `no`

### Dependencies

Imports `lib/benchmark.yaml` for the `run_benchmark` fragment.
