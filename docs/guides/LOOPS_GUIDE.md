# Loops Guide

## What Is a Loop?

A loop is a YAML-defined automation workflow that runs commands, evaluates results, and decides what to do next — without you prompting each step. Under the hood, each loop is a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: a set of states connected by transitions, with a clear start and end.

Why does this matter? LLMs are stateless — they don't remember what happened two prompts ago. The FSM gives them persistent memory of what was tried, what worked, and when to stop.

```
You write:    FSM YAML (or use /ll:create-loop)
You run:      ll-loop run <name>
```

## How Loops Work

Loops live in `.loops/` as YAML files. Each loop has:

- **States** — units of work (run a check, apply a fix, etc.)
- **Transitions** — edges between states (on success go here, on failure go there)

When a loop runs, the engine:

1. Enters the **initial state** and runs its action
2. Evaluates the result (exit code, output pattern, metric, etc.)
3. Follows the matching **transition** to the next state
4. Repeats until reaching a **terminal state** or hitting `max_iterations`

Use `/ll:create-loop` for an interactive wizard that guides you through creating loops, or write FSM YAML directly (see the [FSM Loop System Design](../generalized-fsm-loop.md) for the schema).

## Common Loop Patterns

```
What are you trying to do?
│
├─ Fix a specific problem ──────────▶ Fix until clean
│   "Run check, if fails run fix, repeat"
│
├─ Maintain multiple standards ─────▶ Maintain constraints
│   "Check A, fix A, check B, fix B, ..."
│
├─ Reduce/increase a metric ────────▶ Drive a metric
│   "Measure, if not at target, fix, measure again"
│
└─ Run ordered steps ───────────────▶ Run a sequence
    "Do step 1, do step 2, check if done, repeat"
```

| Loop type | States | Branching | Best for |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Fix until clean | evaluate, fix, done | Binary (pass/fail) | Single check + fix |
| Drive a metric | measure, apply, done | Three-way (target/progress/stall) | Metric optimization |
| Maintain constraints | 2 per constraint + 1 | Binary per constraint | Multi-gate quality |
| Run a sequence | 1 per step + 2 | Binary exit check | Ordered workflows |

Use `/ll:create-loop` to build any of these interactively. The wizard generates FSM YAML ready to run.

## Walkthrough: Creating and Running a Loop

Here's a complete example: a loop that fixes test failures until all tests pass.

### 1. Create

Run `/ll:create-loop` to use the interactive wizard. Or write the FSM YAML directly:

```yaml
name: fix-tests
initial: evaluate
max_iterations: 10
states:
  evaluate:
    action: "pytest tests/"
    on_success: done
    on_failure: fix
    on_error: fix
  fix:
    action: "Fix failing tests based on the pytest output"
    action_type: prompt
    next: evaluate
  done:
    terminal: true
```

Save this to `.loops/fix-tests.yaml`.

### 2. Validate

```bash
ll-loop validate fix-tests
```

The validator checks your YAML for schema errors, unreachable states, and missing transitions.

### 3. Inspect

```bash
ll-loop show fix-tests
```

Output:

```
Loop: fix-tests
Description: All tests pass
Max iterations: 10
Source: .loops/fix-tests.yaml

States:
  [evaluate] [INITIAL]
    action: pytest tests/
    on_success ──→ done
    on_failure ──→ fix
    on_error ──→ fix
  [fix]
    action: Fix failing tests based on the pytest output
    type: prompt
    next ──→ evaluate
  [done] [TERMINAL]

Diagram:
  ┌──────────┐             ┌──────┐
  │ evaluate │───success──▶│ done │
  └──────────┘             └──────┘
       │ ▲
  fail │ │ next
       ▼ │
     ┌─────┐
     │ fix │
     └─────┘

Run command:
  ll-loop run fix-tests
```

### 4. Run

```bash
ll-loop run fix-tests
```

The engine enters `evaluate`, runs `pytest tests/`, checks the exit code, and follows the transition. If tests fail, it enters `fix`, sends the fix prompt to Claude, then returns to `evaluate`. This continues until tests pass or `max_iterations` is reached.

### 5. Monitor

```bash
ll-loop status fix-tests     # Current state and iteration count
ll-loop history fix-tests    # Full execution history
```

## Built-in Loops

These loops ship with little-loops and cover common workflows. Install one to `.loops/` to customize it:

```bash
ll-loop install <name>       # Copies to .loops/ for editing
```

| Loop | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `fix-quality-and-tests` | Sequential quality gate: fix lint, format, and types before running tests; loops back after test fixes to catch regressions |
| `issue-refinement` | Progressively refine all active issues through format, verify, and confidence scoring |

## Beyond the Basics

The sections below cover features you'll encounter as you move past simple loops. For full technical details — schema definitions, compiler internals, and advanced examples — see the [FSM Loop System Design](../generalized-fsm-loop.md).

### Evaluators

Evaluators interpret action output and produce a **verdict** string used for routing. Every state gets a default evaluator based on its action type.

| Evaluator | Verdicts | Default for | When to use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `exit_code` | `success` / `failure` / `error` | shell commands | CLI tools that report pass/fail via exit code |
| `output_numeric` | `success` / `failure` / `error` | — | Compare parsed numeric output to a target |
| `output_json` | `success` / `failure` / `error` | — | Extract a JSON path value and compare |
| `output_contains` | `success` / `failure` | — | Regex or substring match on stdout |
| `convergence` | `target` / `progress` / `stall` | metric-tracking states | Track a metric toward a goal value |
| `llm_structured` | `success` / `failure` / `blocked` / `partial` | slash commands | Natural-language judgment via LLM |

Override the default by adding an `evaluate:` block to a state:

```yaml
evaluate:
  type: output_contains
  pattern: "All checks passed"
```

### Variable Interpolation

Use `${namespace.path}` in action strings, evaluator configs, and routing targets. Variables are resolved at runtime.

| Namespace | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `context` | User-defined variables from the `context:` block | `${context.src_dir}` |
| `captured` | Values stored by `capture:` in earlier states | `${captured.lint.output}` |
| `prev` | Previous state's result (output, exit_code) | `${prev.output}` |
| `result` | Current evaluation result | `${result.verdict}` |
| `state` | Current state metadata | `${state.name}`, `${state.iteration}` |
| `loop` | Loop-level metadata | `${loop.name}`, `${loop.elapsed}` |
| `env` | Environment variables | `${env.HOME}` |

Escape literal `${` with `$${`.

### Capture

Store a state's action output for use in later states:

```yaml
states:
  measure:
    action: "ruff check src/ 2>&1 | grep -c 'error' || echo 0"
    capture: lint_count
    next: apply
```

The captured value is accessible as `${captured.lint_count.output}`, `${captured.lint_count.stderr}`, `${captured.lint_count.exit_code}`, and `${captured.lint_count.duration_ms}`.

### Routing

States use **shorthand** (`on_success`, `on_failure`, `on_partial`) or a **route table** for verdict-to-state mapping:

```yaml
route:
  success: done
  failure: fix
  _: retry        # default for unmatched verdicts
  _error: error   # fallback for evaluation errors
```

Use `$current` as a target to retry the current state. Use `_` for a default route when no other verdict matches.

### Action Types

Each state's action is executed in one of three modes:

| Type | Syntax hint | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `shell` | No `/` prefix | Run as shell command, capture stdout/stderr/exit code |
| `slash_command` | Starts with `/` | Execute a Claude Code slash command |
| `prompt` | Natural language | Send text to Claude as a prompt |

The engine auto-detects type: `/` prefix → `slash_command`, otherwise → `shell`. Set `action_type: prompt` explicitly for natural-language fix instructions.

### Handoff Behavior

When a loop detects that Claude's context window is approaching its limit, it triggers a **handoff**:

| Mode | `on_handoff:` value | Behavior |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| Pause | `pause` (default) | Save state to disk, resume later with `ll-loop resume` |
| Spawn | `spawn` | Save state and launch a fresh Claude session to continue |
| Terminate | `terminate` | Stop the loop immediately (state is not saved) |

### Scope-Based Concurrency

The `scope:` field declares which paths a loop operates on. The engine uses file-based locking to prevent two loops from modifying the same files simultaneously.

```yaml
scope:
  - "src/"
  - "tests/"
```

If a conflicting loop is already running, `ll-loop run` will error. Use `--queue` to wait for the conflict to resolve instead.

| `all-fail` | Every evaluation returns failure/stall |
| `first-fail` | First evaluation fails, rest succeed |
| `alternating` | Alternates between success and failure |

## Pattern: Using `--check` with Exit Code Evaluators

Issue prep skills (`format-issue`, `verify-issues`, `ready-issue`, `confidence-check`, `issue-size-review`, `map-dependencies`, `normalize-issues`, `prioritize-issues`) support a `--check` flag that runs analysis without side effects and exits non-zero when work remains. This makes them usable as FSM loop evaluators with `evaluate: type: exit_code`.

**Important**: Since `/ll:` commands are auto-detected as prompt actions by the executor, states using `--check` must explicitly set `evaluate: type: exit_code` to bypass LLM-structured evaluation.

### Example: Prep-Sprint Invariants Loop

```yaml
name: prep-sprint
description: |
  Ensure all active issues pass prep gates before sprint planning.
  Checks format compliance, verification, sizing, dependencies, and readiness.
initial: check-format
states:
  check-format:
    action: "/ll:format-issue --all --check"
    action_type: slash_command
    evaluate:
      type: exit_code
    on_success: check-verify
    on_failure: fix-format
  fix-format:
    action: "/ll:format-issue --all --auto"
    action_type: slash_command
    next: check-format
  check-verify:
    action: "/ll:verify-issues --check"
    action_type: slash_command
    evaluate:
      type: exit_code
    on_success: check-size
    on_failure: fix-verify
  fix-verify:
    action: "Run /ll:verify-issues --auto to fix verification issues."
    action_type: prompt
    next: check-verify
  check-size:
    action: "/ll:issue-size-review --check"
    action_type: slash_command
    evaluate:
      type: exit_code
    on_success: check-deps
    on_failure: fix-size
  fix-size:
    action: "Run /ll:issue-size-review --auto to decompose oversized issues."
    action_type: prompt
    next: check-size
  check-deps:
    action: "/ll:map-dependencies --check"
    action_type: slash_command
    evaluate:
      type: exit_code
    on_success: done
    on_failure: fix-deps
  fix-deps:
    action: "/ll:map-dependencies --auto"
    action_type: slash_command
    next: check-deps
  done:
    terminal: true
max_iterations: 20
timeout: 3600
```

Each `check-*` state uses `evaluate: type: exit_code` to route on the skill's exit code (0=success, 1=failure). The corresponding `fix-*` states run the skill in auto mode to remediate, then loop back to re-check.

## Tips

- **Start with low `max_iterations`** (5-10) while developing a loop. Increase once the logic is proven.
- **Use `backoff:`** to add delay between iterations — useful for rate-limited APIs or CI systems.
- **State is persisted to disk** after every transition. If a loop is interrupted, `ll-loop resume` picks up where it left off.
- **Convergence loops** use `direction:` to control whether the metric should go down (`minimize`, default) or up (`maximize`).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Loop stuck in a cycle | Fix action isn't changing the result the evaluator sees | Check `ll-loop history` — if the same verdict repeats, adjust the fix action |
| Scope conflict error | Another loop holds a lock on overlapping paths | Find it with `ll-loop list --running` and stop it, or use `--queue` to wait |
| LLM evaluator errors | Claude CLI auth or network issue | Ensure `claude` CLI is authenticated (`claude auth`), or use `--no-llm` to fall back to deterministic evaluators |
| "No state found" on resume | Loop already completed or was never started | Check `ll-loop status` — completed loops have no resumable state |
