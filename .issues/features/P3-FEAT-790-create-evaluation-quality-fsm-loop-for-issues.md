# FEAT-790: Create evaluation-quality FSM Loop for Issues

## Summary

Add a `loops/evaluation-quality.yaml` FSM loop that performs a multi-dimensional quality health check across issue quality (confidence scores, format status), code quality (test/lint), and backlog health (size, velocity), produces a scored report, routes to targeted remediation loops when thresholds are breached, and terminates with a persisted quality snapshot. Designed to run periodically (before sprint planning or weekly).

## Context

Derived from the [Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering) repo's `evaluation` skill, which identifies that 95% of performance variance is explained by: token usage (~80%), tool calls (~10%), and model choice (~5%). The key adaptation: in little-loops, "performance" maps to issue quality and implementation outcome predictability — measured by confidence scores vs. actual completion rates.

The loop is designed as a **diagnostic-and-delegate** pattern, not a fix-it loop. It measures, scores, identifies the primary concern, delegates remediation to existing focused loops (`issue-refinement`, `fix-quality-and-tests`, `backlog-flow-optimizer`), and saves a health snapshot report.

## Use Case

**Who**: A developer preparing for sprint planning or reviewing project health.

**Context**: Issues have been accumulating over time. Some are unformatted, some have low confidence scores, code quality may have drifted, and backlog distribution might be skewed. Rather than running each remediation loop blindly, the developer wants a single loop that measures everything and tells them what needs attention most.

**Goal**: Run `ll-loop run evaluation-quality` and get a scored health report with the primary concern identified and remediation triggered.

**Outcome**: A `quality-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` file in `.loops/` with per-dimension scores, primary concern identified, and top 3 remediation recommendations. If a primary concern is found, the relevant remediation loop is invoked before the report is written.

## Expected Behavior

```
sample → evaluate_code → score → route_action → [remediate_issues | remediate_code | remediate_backlog | report] → done
```

1. **sample** (shell): Collect issue quality metrics via `ll-issues list --format json` — count active/scored/unscored/unformatted, compute avg confidence scores, identify below-threshold issues.
2. **evaluate_code** (shell): Run test suite + lint, pipe results to `.loops/tmp/eval-test-results.txt`.
3. **score** (prompt): LLM synthesizes signals into per-dimension scores (0-100) and emits a structured `SCORES:` block with `PRIMARY_CONCERN` tag.
4. **route_action** (evaluate): Routes on `PRIMARY_CONCERN: NONE` → `report`, otherwise routes to the appropriate remediation state.
5. **remediate_issues** (prompt): Invokes `issue-refinement` loop (or `ll:confidence-check --all --auto`).
6. **remediate_code** (prompt): Invokes `fix-quality-and-tests` loop.
7. **remediate_backlog** (prompt): Invokes `backlog-flow-optimizer` loop.
8. **report** (prompt): Writes `.loops/quality-report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` with scores, trends (if prior reports exist), and top 3 action items.
9. **done** (terminal).

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `loops/evaluation-quality.yaml`.
2. **sample state** (shell): Use `ll-issues list --format json` with inline Python to compute: `total_active`, `scored`, `unscored`, `unformatted`, `avg_confidence_score`, `avg_outcome_confidence`, `below_threshold` count. Also call `ll-history summary` for completion velocity.
3. **evaluate_code state** (shell): Read `test_cmd` from `.claude/ll-config.json` (same pattern as `fix-quality-and-tests.yaml`). Run lint (`ruff check`) separately from tests to get independent signals.
4. **score state** (prompt): Structured scoring prompt with exact output format — `SCORES:` block with `issue_quality`, `code_health`, `backlog_health`, `overall`, and `PRIMARY_CONCERN:` tag. Use `output_contains` on `PRIMARY_CONCERN: NONE` to route.
5. **route_* states** (evaluate): Chain of `output_contains` checks on `captured.scores.output` — same pattern as `backlog-flow-optimizer.yaml`'s route chain.
6. **remediate_* states** (prompt): Each delegates to an existing loop via subprocess (`ll-loop run <name>`) or prompt. Keep timeouts generous (600s) since sub-loops are long.
7. **report state** (prompt): Writes markdown report to `.loops/quality-report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`. If prior reports exist in `.loops/`, compute trend direction (↑↓→) per dimension.
8. Set `max_iterations: 5` (diagnostic loop, not iterative fixer), `timeout: 3600`.

## API/Interface

New file: `loops/evaluation-quality.yaml`

Invoked via:
```bash
ll-loop run evaluation-quality
```

Produces: `.loops/quality-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Reads (no changes): `.claude/ll-config.json` (for `test_cmd`), `.issues/` (via `ll-issues list`), `.loops/quality-report-*.md` (prior reports for trend calculation).

## Motivation

- **Gap**: No existing loop provides a unified health view across issues + code + backlog. The closest is `backlog-flow-optimizer`, but it only covers backlog bloat, not code quality or issue scoring quality.
- **Sprint hygiene**: Running this before `ll:create-sprint` ensures the issues being selected are high-quality and the codebase is clean.
- **LLM-as-judge pattern**: The repo's `evaluation` skill recommends combining outcome-focused scoring with LLM-as-judge for scalability. The `score` state implements this directly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `loops/evaluation-quality.yaml` passes `ll-loop validate evaluation-quality`
- [ ] `sample` state correctly reports `total_active`, `scored`, `unscored`, and `avg_confidence_score` from `.issues/`
- [ ] `score` state emits a valid `SCORES:` block with all four fields and `PRIMARY_CONCERN` tag
- [ ] Routes correctly: `PRIMARY_CONCERN: NONE` → `report`, others → appropriate remediation state
- [ ] `report` state writes a valid markdown file to `.loops/quality-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [ ] Loop completes in `max_iterations: 5` under normal conditions
- [ ] Loop terminates cleanly even if `ll-history summary` returns no data (graceful fallback)

## Integration Map

### Files to Create
- `loops/evaluation-quality.yaml` — the FSM loop definition

### Files to Read (no changes)
- `.claude/ll-config.json` — `test_cmd`, `lint_cmd`
- `.issues/` — via `ll-issues list --format json`

### Files Written
- `.loops/quality-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — quality health snapshot

### Loops Delegated To
- `loops/issue-refinement.yaml` — invoked by `remediate_issues` state
- `loops/fix-quality-and-tests.yaml` — invoked by `remediate_code` state
- `loops/backlog-flow-optimizer.yaml` — invoked by `remediate_backlog` state

### Similar Patterns
- `loops/backlog-flow-optimizer.yaml` — measure (shell) → diagnose (prompt) → route chain → act → loop pattern
- `loops/issue-refinement.yaml` — `ll-issues list --format json` + Python classifier pattern for shell evaluate state
- `loops/fix-quality-and-tests.yaml` — `test_cmd` from `ll-config.json` pattern

## Impact

- **Priority**: P3 — Useful sprint-hygiene loop; not blocking
- **Effort**: Small — single YAML file, no code changes
- **Risk**: Low — additive, delegates to existing loops for remediation
- **Breaking Change**: No
