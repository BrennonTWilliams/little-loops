# ENH-1395: Add New-Skill Classification Policy to CONTRIBUTING.md

## Summary

Add a "New Skill Checklist" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` that defines when a skill should be LLM-discoverable vs. user-invocable only, enforces a description character limit, and requires a `/doctor` budget check before each release. This prevents the listing budget truncation from recurring as new skills are added.

## Current Behavior

`CONTRIBUTING.md` has no guidance on skill classification. Every new skill defaults to LLM-discoverable (full description in listing budget) because there is no documented policy and no checklist to follow. The listing budget has already been exceeded once and will exceed again as new skills are added.

## Expected Behavior

`CONTRIBUTING.md` includes a "New Skill Checklist" section with:
1. A classification decision tree: "Does the LLM need to discover this skill from natural language? If no, add `disable-model-invocation: true`"
2. Description length cap: ≤ 100 characters for LLM-discoverable skills, no bullet lists
3. A release checklist item: run `/doctor` and confirm 0 skill descriptions dropped before tagging

## Motivation

ENH-1394 fixes the current truncation by tagging 17 existing skills. Without a documented policy, the next batch of new skills will recreate the same problem. The cost of a doc addition is negligible; the cost of rediscovering this issue each release is ongoing session quality degradation.

## Proposed Solution

Add a new section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` between the existing "Skills" and "Testing" sections:

```markdown
### New Skill Checklist

Before adding a new skill, answer:

1. **Will users always type this command explicitly?**
   If yes → add `disable-model-invocation: true` to frontmatter. Examples: `update`, `cleanup-worktrees`, `audit-loop-run`, `analyze-history`.

2. **Should the LLM route to this skill from natural language?**
   If yes → keep default (no flag). Keep the `description` field ≤ 100 characters. No bullet lists in descriptions.

3. **Before release:** run `/doctor` and verify "0 skill descriptions dropped". If any are dropped, tag more skills with `disable-model-invocation: true` or shorten descriptions.
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Open `CONTRIBUTING.md` and locate the "Skills" section
2. Add the "New Skill Checklist" subsection with the decision tree above
3. Add a release checklist item in the existing release process section (if one exists) referencing `/doctor`

## Integration Map

### Files to Modify
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — add "New Skill Checklist" subsection under Skills

### Dependent Files (Callers/Importers)
- N/A — documentation only

### Similar Patterns
- Existing "New Command Checklist" or similar sections in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if present)

### Tests
- N/A

### Documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the only file changed

### Configuration
- N/A

## Impact

- **Priority**: P3 — prevents recurrence of ENH-1394's root cause
- **Effort**: Very low — documentation addition only
- **Risk**: None
- **Breaking Change**: No

## Labels

`enhancement`, `documentation`, `skills`, `context-engineering`
