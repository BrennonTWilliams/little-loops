# EPIC-2178: Gemini CLI host adapter — tracking

## Summary

Google's `gemini-cli` is a major AI coding-agent platform. This epic is the
umbrella tracking Gemini host adapter support — analogous to EPIC-1463 (Codex
interop gaps) and EPIC-1713 (Pi parity gap tracking). No implementation should
land before the research spike establishes the gemini-cli hook/lifecycle model,
binary surface, and plugin discovery mechanism.

## Motivation

`gemini-cli` is a major AI coding-agent CLI from Google with significant and
growing adoption. Adding it as a supported host brings little-loops automation
(`ll-auto`, `ll-sprint`, `ll-loop`, FSM loops) to Gemini users. The
architecture already supports N hosts via `resolve_host()` / `HostRunner`
protocol; adding Gemini follows the established 4-layer pattern:

1. Runner stub → `host_runner.py`
2. Hook adapter → `hooks/adapters/gemini/`
3. Config probe → `config/core.py`
4. Parity matrix → `docs/reference/HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md`

## Goal

Gemini CLI users can run `ll-auto`, `ll-loop`, and FSM-based automation loops
with `LL_HOST_CLI=gemini`, with hook lifecycle events (`session_start`,
`pre_compact` at minimum) firing correctly.

End-state acceptance: a Gemini column exists in
`docs/reference/HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md` with no unknown or untracked cells —
every cell is ✓, ✗ (with a tracking issue), or N/A.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- **Research spike** — audit `gemini` CLI binary surface: headless/streaming
  flags, JSON output mode, lifecycle hook events (payload shape, available
  events), plugin/skill/command discovery surface. Analogous to FEAT-1483
  (Codex research spike).
- **`GeminiRunner` stub** in `scripts/little_loops/host_runner.py` — raises
  `HostNotConfigured` on all `build_*` calls; added to `_HOST_RUNNER_REGISTRY`
  and `_PROBE_ORDER` as `("gemini", "gemini")`. Analogous to `PiRunner`.
- **Hook adapter** `hooks/adapters/gemini/` — adapter scripts translating
  gemini-cli lifecycle events → `LLHookEvent`. Shape depends on research spike.
- **Config probe** — `.gemini/ll-config.json` probe path added to
  `config/core.py _config_candidates()`.
- **`HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md` Gemini column** — new column tracking parity cells
  (hook intents, skill/command discovery, orchestration CLI flags).
- **Skill/command adaptation** — whatever Gemini's plugin surface turns out to
  be (analogous to FEAT-1486 for Codex Skills API).
- **`GeminiRunner` full implementation** — real `build_streaming`,
  `build_blocking_json`, `build_detached`, `build_version_check` once CLI
  surface is audited.
- **Conformance test suite** — `ll-auto` / `ll-sprint` / `ll-loop` golden paths
  against `gemini -p` (analogous to FEAT-1721 for Codex).

**Out of scope:**

- Gemini API direct integration (this is about the `gemini-cli` coding-agent
  host, not the Gemini REST API)
- Changes to existing Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or Pi adapters

## Children

- **FEAT-2179** — Research spike: gemini-cli binary surface, hook events, and plugin discovery ✓
- **ENH-2184** — GeminiRunner stub in host_runner.py
- **ENH-2185** — GeminiRunner full implementation (build_streaming, build_blocking_json, build_detached, build_version_check)
- **FEAT-2186** — Hook adapter — hooks/adapters/gemini/ (decision needed: settings.json injection vs extension)
- **ENH-2187** — Config probe — .gemini/ll-config.json in _config_candidates()
- **FEAT-2188** — Skills adaptation — ll-adapt-skills-for-gemini
- **FEAT-2189** — Commands adaptation — ll-adapt-commands-for-gemini (.md → .toml)
- **FEAT-2190** — GEMINI.md project context file (ll:init --gemini)
- **ENH-2191** — HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md Gemini column — populate cells as children land
- **FEAT-2192** — Conformance test suite (ll-auto/ll-sprint/ll-loop golden paths)

## Implementation Steps

1. Land research spike (FEAT-2179) — all downstream work depends on its findings.
2. Add `GeminiRunner` stub to `host_runner.py` + `_PROBE_ORDER` entry.
3. Wire `hooks/adapters/gemini/` adapter based on research findings.
4. Add `.gemini/ll-config.json` config probe.
5. Add Gemini column to `HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md`.
6. Adapt ll skills/commands for Gemini's plugin surface.
7. Implement full `GeminiRunner` (replace stub `HostNotConfigured` raises).
8. Conformance test suite.

## Success Metrics

- `LL_HOST_CLI=gemini` resolves without error on a machine with `gemini` on PATH.
- `session_start` and `pre_compact` hook intents fire on Gemini.
- `ll-auto` can process at least one issue end-to-end using the Gemini runner.
- All Gemini column cells in `HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md` are ✓, ✗ (linked), or N/A.

## Integration Map

### Files to Modify

- `scripts/little_loops/host_runner.py` — `GeminiRunner` class, `_HOST_RUNNER_REGISTRY`, `_PROBE_ORDER`, `_remediation_hint()`
- `scripts/little_loops/config/core.py` — `_config_candidates()` for `.gemini/ll-config.json` probe
- `docs/reference/HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md` — new Gemini column
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — `GeminiRunner` in component table

### New Files

- `hooks/adapters/gemini/hooks.json`
- `hooks/adapters/gemini/session-start.sh`
- `hooks/adapters/gemini/pre-compact.sh`
- `hooks/adapters/gemini/README.md`
- `scripts/tests/test_gemini_adapter.py`

### Dependent Files

- `scripts/little_loops/hooks/__main__.py` — intent dispatch table
- `scripts/tests/test_host_runner.py` — `GeminiRunner` coverage

## Impact

- **Priority**: P4 — Gemini is a widely-used platform with significant user
  demand potential; higher than the Pi/Codex tracking epics (P5) but still a
  tracking epic with no confirmed user demand in hand.
- **Effort**: Large (aggregate) — each child is Small–Medium; total is
  Medium–Large once all 8 steps land.
- **Risk**: Low-Medium — additive, host-specific; no Claude Code behavior
  change. Main risk is that gemini-cli's hook/lifecycle model differs enough
  from Claude Code's that the adapter layer needs new abstractions. Research
  spike de-risks this.
- **Breaking Change**: No.

## Verification Notes

2026-06-18 (IN PROGRESS): FEAT-2179 (research spike) is complete — `thoughts/research/gemini-cli-surface.md` exists. All remaining 9 children still open. No `GeminiRunner` in `host_runner.py`; `hooks/adapters/gemini/` does not exist; no `.gemini` config probe; no skills/commands adaptation scripts. Next logical child: ENH-2184 (GeminiRunner stub, XS effort).
