❯ /ll:init --interactive --force

⏺ I'll initialize little-loops configuration for this project. Since the --force flag is provided and the
  configuration already exists, I'll overwrite it. Let me first detect the project type and structure.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/pyproject.toml")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/package.json")
  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/requirements.txt")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/go.mod")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/Cargo.toml")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

⏺ Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 192
     drwxr-xr-x  31 brennon  staff    992 Jan 22 10:42 .
     drwxr-xr-x   6 brennon  staff    192 Jan 21 14:41 ..
     … +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I can see this is a mixed Python/Node.js monorepo project called "Agrobot" with:
  - Python backend services: orchestration_app/, memory_app/, db_app/, memory_insights_app/, evaluations/
  - Node.js frontend: frontend/
  - Existing .issues/ directory for issue tracking

  Let me examine the existing configuration and pyproject.toml to understand current settings.

⏺ Read(.claude/ll-config.json)
  ⎿  Read 24 lines

⏺ Read(pyproject.toml)
  ⎿  Read 26 lines

⏺ Now I have a good understanding of the project. Since --interactive flag is set, I'll use the interactive wizard.
  Let me start with Round 1 - Core Project Settings.

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Is 'Agrobot' the correct project name? → Yes, use Agrobot
     · Which source directory contains your code? → . (root)
     · Which test command should be used? → pytest
     · Which lint command should be used? → ruff check .

⏺ Round 1 complete. Now Round 2 - Additional Configuration.

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which format command should be used? → ruff format .
     · Found existing '.issues/' directory. Use it for issue tracking? → Yes, use .issues/
     · Which directories should be scanned for code issues? → orchestration_app/, memory_app/, db_app/, frontend/
     · Add custom exclude patterns beyond defaults? → Use defaults only

⏺ Round 2 complete. Now Round 3 - Features Selection.

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which advanced features do you want to enable? → Parallel processing, Context monitoring

⏺ Both features selected. Now Round 4 - Advanced Settings (for parallel worktree files and context threshold).

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which additional files should be copied to each git worktree? (Note: .claude/ is always copied
     automatically) → .env files per app
     · At what context usage percentage should auto-handoff trigger? → 80%

⏺ All rounds complete. Here's the configuration summary:

  ================================================================================
  LITTLE-LOOPS INITIALIZATION
  ================================================================================

  Detected project type: Python (monorepo with Node.js frontend)

  Configuration Summary:

    [PROJECT]
    project.name:       Agrobot
    project.src_dir:    .
    project.test_cmd:   pytest
    project.lint_cmd:   ruff check .
    project.format_cmd: ruff format .

    [ISSUES]
    issues.base_dir:    .issues

    [SCAN]
    scan.focus_dirs:    orchestration_app/, memory_app/, db_app/, frontend/
    scan.exclude_patterns: **/__pycache__/**, **/.venv/**, **/node_modules/**, **/dist/**

    [PARALLEL]
    parallel.worktree_copy_files: db_app/.env, frontend/.env, memory_app/.env, orchestration_app/.env

    [CONTEXT MONITOR]
    context_monitor.enabled: true

  ================================================================================

  Since --interactive was used, proceeding directly with configuration creation (user has already approved through the
   wizard).

⏺ Write(.claude/ll-config.json)
  ⎿  

⏺ Now let me check and update .gitignore for state file exclusions.

⏺ Read(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Read 187 lines

⏺ The .gitignore already has the little-loops state file exclusions (lines 184-186). No update needed.

  ================================================================================
  INITIALIZATION COMPLETE
  ================================================================================

   ╭╮      ╭╮

    little loops

  Overwritten: .claude/ll-config.json
  Verified: .gitignore (state file exclusions already present)

  Next steps:
    1. Review and customize: .claude/ll-config.json
    2. Try a command: /ll:check_code
    3. Issue tracking ready: .issues/ directory exists
    4. Run parallel processing: ll-parallel
